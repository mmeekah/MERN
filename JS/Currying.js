// Currying is the idea that you only run part of a function, rather than the whole thing.



// Example: Uncurried
function ninjaBelt(ninja, beltColor){
  console.log("Ninja "+ ninja + " has earned a " + beltColor +" belt.");
}
ninjaBelt('Eileen', 'black');


// Example:Curried
function ninjaBelt(ninja){
    return function belt(beltColor){ //note the closure here!
      console.log("Ninja "+ ninja + " has earned a " + beltColor +" belt.");
    }
  }
  ninjaBelt('Eileen')('black'); //note the double invocation here.
